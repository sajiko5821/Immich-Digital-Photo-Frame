# Immich-Digital-Photo-Frame
This Python script automatically fetches photos from a specified Immich album, processes and corrects the aspect ratio of portrait images for a 16:10 display by adding a blurred background, and prepares the final, shuffled images for deployment to a Home Assistant slideshow directory.
